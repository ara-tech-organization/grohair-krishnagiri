    question: "What hair loss treatments are available in Krishnagiri?",
    answer:
      "At GroHair Krishnagiri, we provide FUE Hair Transplants, PRP therapy, Mesotherapy, Scalp Micropigmentation, and Low-Level Laser Therapy to control hair fall and support healthy regrowth",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the hair transplant process work?",
    answer:
      "Healthy follicles are moved from a donor area—usually the back of your head—to thinning or bald spots. These implanted hairs grow naturally and permanently.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will the results of hair transplantation last forever?",
    answer:
      "Yes, for most people. Transplanted follicles are generally resistant to hair loss and can grow for a lifetime with the right care.",
  },
  {
    question: "When can I expect visible results after a transplant?",
    answer:
      "You’ll start seeing new growth by 3–4 months, with full transformation typically complete within 9–12 months",
  },
  {
    question: "How does PRP therapy improve hair growth?",
    answer:
      "PRP uses your body’s own growth factors from blood plasma to energize dormant hair follicles and encourage natural growth.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are your hair treatments safe?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. All procedures are performed under expert supervision using proven, safe methods. Minor side effects like redness may occur but fade quickly",
  },
  {
    question: "What impacts the cost of a hair transplant?",
    answer:
      "Cost depends on how many grafts are needed, your scalp condition, and the technique used. We’ll give you a clear estimate after a consultation.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How can I book a consultation with the GroHair Krishnagiri team?",
    answer:
      "You can call us, walk into our Krishnagiri clinic, or schedule through our online form. We’ll set you up with a personalized session",
